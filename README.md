Project Title: Unemployment Rate Analysis in India

Description:
This project analyzes the unemployment rate data in India sourced from a CSV file. The dataset includes information on unemployment rates, employment numbers, labour participation rates across different regions and areas (rural/urban) over a specific period.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to explore and visualize the unemployment rate data to uncover insights into regional disparities, temporal trends, and correlations with other economic indicators.

Key Steps and Analysis:
-	Data Loading and Cleaning:
Loaded the dataset using Pandas and cleaned it by handling missing values and duplicates.
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of unemployment rates using histograms.
Created a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labour participation rates.
-	Geospatial and Temporal Analysis:
Visualized unemployment rates across regions and areas using a sunburst chart to identify geographical patterns.
Introduced temporal analysis by creating a 'Year_Month' column to track unemployment trends over time.
-	Statistical Insights:
Calculated basic statistics and identified extreme values in the unemployment rate data.
Provided insights into regional disparities and seasonal variations.

Conclusion and Recommendations:
Summarized findings and inferred insights from the analysis.
Suggested areas for further investigation, such as understanding the drivers behind extreme unemployment rates and exploring policy implications.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Plotly Express for interactive visualizations.

Future Enhancements:
Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis of unemployment trends.
Incorporate additional socio-economic indicators to enrich the analysis.

Repository Structure:
Data: Contains the original dataset (Unemployment in India.csv).
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks (Unemployment_Rate_Analysis.ipynb) containing the complete analysis with explanations and visualizations.
Documentation: README file (README.md) providing project overview, setup instructions, and detailed explanations of the analysis.

Conclusion:
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the unemployment landscape in India through exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques. It serves as a resource for researchers, policymakers, and data enthusiasts interested in understanding regional economic disparities and trends in unemployment rates.
